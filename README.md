### Data
Our Data is Chicago Trafic Crashs - Crashs Dataset

<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if">Traffic Crashes - Crashes | City of Chicago</a>  

### Task 1:Single view visualizations

## Graph 1:
The attached bar graph visualizes the number of crashes per year based on the CRASH_DATE field. The x-axis is ordinal, meaning that the order of the values is meaningful. The y-axis is quantitative, meaning that the values represent a quantity.

# Attributes being visualized:
Year (CRASH_DATE)
Number of crashes (CRASH_NUM)
Type of chart:
Bar graph

# Insights from the visualization:
The visualization shows that the number of crashes has decreased by 66% over the past decade. This is a positive trend, but it is important to continue to work to reduce the number of crashes even further.

# How we leveraged my sketch as a starting point for this visualization:
We started by sketching out my ideas for the visualization. We wanted to create a simple but effective bar graph that would show the trend in the number of crashes over time. We labeled my sketch with important information, such as the data We was using, the insights We was trying to communicate, and the target audience for my visualization.

Once We had a rough sketch of my visualization, We began to build it using a visualization tool. We used my sketch as a guide to determine the number of bars, the labels for each bar, and the range of values on the y-axis. We also used my sketch to experiment with different visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and symbols.

# Conclusion:
By leveraging my sketch as a starting point for this visualization, We was able to create a simple but effective bar graph that clearly communicates the trend in the number of crashes over time. We encourage other data visualization practitioners to leverage their sketches as much as possible as a starting point for their visualizations. This can help to create more consistent, visually appealing, and informative visualizations.
